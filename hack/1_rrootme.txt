All steps and concepts about CTF made on https://tryhackme.com/room/rrootme:

1 - PortScaning

    nmap -sV 10.10.150.31

2 - List directories and paths with Gobuster

    cd "/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster"

    gobuster dir -u http://10.10.150.31/ -w directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x php, html, txt
    
3 - Open the Attack Machine on tryhackme

4 - The http://10.10.150.31/ is a webpage site

    On Gobuster, listed the path /panel/ that contains a upload form, this way is a oportunity to upload scripts.
    We can use to upload a malisius** script to 'get a shell'
    This form dont allow upload .php extentions
    But if rename the extention to .php5, it bypass
    Upload the php-reverse-shell.php5 editing the IP and port of Machine tryhackme panel

Making Reverse Sheel - Tune connection

5 - On tryhackme Attack Machine, open the port 3333 with netcat

    nc -nlv 3333

6 - The http://10.10.150.31/upload list all the uploaded files, you'll find the sheel.php5, click on to execute
  
7 - So, the connection will be created, on terminal of tryhackme, you'll execute commands inside server the page is running

8 - The firt flag of CTF is find a file user.txt and get this content

    find / -name user.txt

    cat user.txt
